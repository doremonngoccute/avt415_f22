	<p>Calvin is a college student who has class until 8 p.m. He usually skips his dinner or makes instant noodles when he gets home because he has no time to cook a high-quality meal. One day, Calvin decides to order food online. He found Maki Mart, a store that sells sushi rolls 24 hours a day and can order sushi online for delivery or in person. He decides to order himself a sushi roll for dinner which contains more nutrients than instant noodles and he does not have to cook.</p>
